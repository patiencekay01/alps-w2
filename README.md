It took me far too long just to get the images to appear on the page. In my head, the process makes sense but finding the correct syntax is the issue. The next challenge was to then position all of the images where I wanted them to be, and fix them in that position. When it came to adding accessibility features, my page completely disappeared and it took me too long to bring all of the content back. It seems the smallest effects take so long to action. I would’ve loved to add a highlight boarder around the selected thumbnail image, but it was way too complicated and began ruining other aspects of my site.
